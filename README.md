# Redirector

> ** Redirector ** is an App that simply let you read medium paid articles for free.

# ⚠️ Disclaimer : no longer works ... 

## How

The app is based on that project( [link](https://scribe.rip/) ) and adds value to it providing a more friendly interface and kind of automation to the process...

## Two ways :

- Simply open the app, and paste an article link you've already copied

- Use the native share functionality of your device(browser, medium app, etc..) to send the link directly to the App.
(This feature is currently not available for IOS devices)

## The App

You can use it online straight from the site: [Redirector](https://redirector-theta.vercel.app/)
